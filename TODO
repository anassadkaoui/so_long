COLLECTIBLE, EXIT, PLAYER - MUST EXISTS
cleanup (mlx and any allocated memory) before exit
check the size of the map corresponding with the display of mac
check the xpm files when uploading
check extension of the file opened `.ber`
check the syscall if they failed
check every allocation, and free before exiting
check map rectangle (new line in the last row not allowed)
check mlx function if they failed!
Makefile (relink and no wildcards)








=>freeing dynamic allocated memory using malloc, destroying the mlx window and environment(windows, images)
=>handle when the program exits due to an error(the program terminated unexpectedly)


FINAL THOUGHT:doing this using and exit handler function, make sure to call the cleanup_exit func at any error handling.


frow where the problem of the installed valgrind heppened???
